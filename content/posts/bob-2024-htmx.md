As was [announced
recently](https://funktionale-programmierung.de/2024/07/29/bob-retro.html), the
videos of BOBKonf 2024 are finally up. I was invited to give a talk on
[HTMX](https://htmx.org) and did so, somewhat successfully. You can watch the
full video at
[media.ccc](https://media.ccc.de/v/bob11-2024-javascript-fatigue-und-die-hypermedia-renaissance-schneider).
It was crazy hot in there, so please forgive my sweaty face ðŸ˜…

To give a talk at BOBKonf is something very special to me, given that I have
been one of the organisers since around 2015. I've seen lots of great talks and
met a lot of awesome people there. I'm already looking forward to 2025!
