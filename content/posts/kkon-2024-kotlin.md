Just like last year, I'm going to offer a workshop on functional programming in
Kotlin at [KKon
2024](https://rheinwerk-kkon.de/workshops/schneider-einstieg-funktionale-programmierung-einstieg/)
on September 17th. I had loads of fun last year and met a lot of great people
there, so I am hyped to run the workshop once again. The workshop is going to be
in German and will start from the very basics (data analysis, data structures,
lists, ...) and -- if we're lucky -- we are going to end on the dreaded
m-word[^1]. Just like last year, we're running the workshop remotely. There
should still be [tickets left](https://rheinwerk-kkon.de). Hope to see you
there!
