Some small libraries that might be useful for others.

## OCaml

- [neshtea/mjson](https://github.com/neshtea/mjson): a small OCaml library for
  decoding JSON-values. Backend-agnostic, currently supports
  [yojson](https://github.com/ocaml-community/yojson).

## Clojure

  access with Clojure based on a monadic query language.
