# Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Marco Schneider, I live in Berlin and I write software.  I work at [Active
Group GmbH](https://active-group.de), one of the leading providers of custom
software using functional programming in Germany.  At Active Group, I work at
different projects utilising a variety of technologies and architectures.  In
addition, I teach functional programming and functional software architecture in
workshops and speak about it at conferences.

## Programming

I'm interested in functional programming and functional software architecture
and it's application in the industry.  I love Lisp-languages such as
Clojure(Script), Scheme or Common Lisp and ML-decendants (Ocaml, Haskell,
&#8230;).  In general, I prefer languages that afford the use of functional
programming techniques, which includes Erlang/Elixir, ECMA-script and more.

For some time now I'm also interested in [nix](https://nixos.org/) and
reproducible builds and delivery of software.

Every now and then I contribute to
[funktionale-programmierung.de](https://funktionale-programmierung.de) &mdash;
the largest German language blog on all things functional programming.
